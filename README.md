# these are the folders that are copied during the fork. Ignore these folders. All my testing is in the MYTEST folder

In MYTEST there are some new files written by me and some files MOVED from the original folders and modified.
This way I can change the directory structure and I can track the changes that will be made by the authors I forked from.

Basically download everything, then keep only the MYTEST folder
